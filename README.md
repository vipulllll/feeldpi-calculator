## 🧠 What is feelDPI?
feelDPI is a normalized measure of how far you need to move your mouse for a full 360° turn in a game. It's more accurate than matching eDPI because it accounts for how each game interprets sensitivity (yaw value).

## 📦 How to use it
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter your current game's name, DPI and sensitivity.
3. Select your target game and desired DPI.
4. The matching sensitivity is shown automatically.
